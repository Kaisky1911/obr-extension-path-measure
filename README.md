This extension allows players to measure the distance of a path along the grid. Works with both hexagonal and rectangular grid settings.

The tool provides three modes:
  - Move: Moves a character while showing the path and measured distance
  - Measure: Only shows path and distance without moving a character
  - Draw: Draws path and distance on the map. Can be deleted manually or using the Clean Up action.

One Action:
  - Clean Up: Only available after a path has been made using the Draw mode. Cleans up all drawn paths.
